### To set up Ollama in Jupyter Notebook  
1. open your anaconda prompt, and activate your environment
2. install Ollama with pip
>pip install ollama

3. Choose the model you want to run (https://ollama.com/search)  
4. if you choose, choose the parameters of the model you chose. (7b,14b...)  
5. check the Ollama command on the right (ex : ollama run deepseek-r1:7b)
6. activate your environment, and enter the Ollama run command. after that, downloading will be starting.
7. open your jupyter notebook with the environment.

Run the command below. See if it works(it needs langchain library.)


```python
#import library
from langchain_ollama.llms import OllamaLLM

#model define, input the model name (ollama run deepseek-r1:7b) => (deepseek-r1:7b)
#11434 is the port number. default is 11434. if you change the port nubmer, change this nubmer
model = OllamaLLM(model="<model name>",base_url="http://127.0.0.1:11434/")

#invoke chain
response = model.invoke("hello! how was your day today?")

#print response
print(response)
```

    Hi! I just noticed that you're saying something about me in my message. It seems like I'm not fully connected to the moment or haven't received my emails yet. How can I assist you today? ðŸ˜Š
    


```python
#using chat prompt template example with Langchain
from langchain_ollama.llms import OllamaLLM
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

#prompt with message template
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a great programmer skilled in C++ language. You will solve coding problems\n"
    "Write your code simply and cleary\n"),
    ("human", "{problem}"),
    ("assistant", "Here is my solution: ..."),

])

#model define
model = OllamaLLM(model="deepseek-coder-v2",base_url="http://127.0.0.1:11434/")

#making chain
chain = prompt | model

#print response
print(chain.invoke({"problem" : """Print * in each line starting with 2, then 4, 6, and so on,
increasing by 2 each time until 10 stars are printed. Once 10 stars are printed,
start decreasing the number of stars by 1 in each line, printing 9, 7, 5, and so on, 
until only 1 star remain"""}))
#I make this problem example. If you have a license with the problem, contact with github.
```

     To solve this problem, we can use a loop to print the required number of asterisks (`*`) in each line. We'll start by incrementing from 2 up to 10 and then decrement back down. Let's write the code for this:
    
    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    
    int main() {
        // Increment phase
        for (int i = 2; i <= 10; i += 2) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                cout << "*";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
        
        // Decrement phase
        for (int i = 9; i >= 1; i -= 2) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                cout << "*";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
        
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    
    This code first uses a loop to print lines with increasing numbers of stars, starting from 2 and incrementing by 2 each time until it reaches 10. After reaching 10 stars, it then decrements the number of stars by 2 in each line, printing lines with 9, 7, 5, and so on, down to 1 star.
